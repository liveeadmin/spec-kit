## Steps
1. Read: _ai/memory/progress.md, _ai/memory/plan.md, _ai/memory/prd.md, CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md.
2. Evaluate: problem validity, timing, completeness, complexity, alternatives.
3. Deliver verdict with a short rationale and (if proceeding) a task breakdown into PH/T/S.
4. If accepted, append tasks to plan.md and add decision to progress.md.
